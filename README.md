      href= "https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors%20target=" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> were founded in 1946 and are now an NBA team located in San Francisco, California coached by Steve Kerr. They play their home games at the Chase Center and are known for their unqiue playing style of shooting long-range. Many famous people have played for the Warrios including Wilt Chamberlain and Andre Iguodala. Currently, renowned players such as <strong>Steph Curry</strong> and Draymond Green are on the team and contribute significantly. 
    <h2>23-24 Season</h2>
        <p>The Warriors finished <strong>46-36</strong> this past season which was 10th in the NBA Conference. This record is tied for the best considering not making the play-offs. Their season ended in the play-in tournament after losing to the Sacramento Kings, where Klay Thompson was held scoreless (0-10). Over the season, they were able take 25 road game wins, which is more than double of last year. However, they faced many adversities such as the passing away of Coach Deki and multiple suspensions that Draymond Green received. There were some promising times though, as young stars Brandon Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis were very impactful rookies.</p>
